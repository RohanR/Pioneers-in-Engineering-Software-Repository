Changes:

- IMPORTANT: SoftwareServo requires you to install the patch found at
http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~wangj/pie/files/SoftwareServo_patch.zip.
Extract the ZIP into [your arduino directory]/hardware/.

(This is the millisSet addon from http://www.curiousinventor.com/kits/roboduino
with the SoftwareServo library removed. But read on:)

- You MUST REMOVE any old SoftwareServo libraries. The software timeout
requires the provided version of SoftwareServo.

- For testing purposes, autonomous mode is enabled if button 10 (Start)
is pressed. See dataLoop() for details. You must reset to exit this mode,
as control data is no longer updated during autonomous.

- Reading IR sensor values: See dataLoop() for an example.

- Timeout (safety feature). If 120 ms elapses without a data packet, then
the robot will zero its outputs and wait for a radio signal. Once it receives
a radio signal, it will reset itself. DISABLING THE TIMEOUT DURING COMPETITION
WILL RESULT IN DISQUALIFICATION.

(The test interface, patch 2, will send a packet every 25ms. This allows 4
dropped packets in a row before the robot shuts down.)

- FYI:
We were having intermittent dropouts with the radios. To fix this, the
XBees need to be changed to "transparent serial mode" prior to the competition.
In the meantime the old code will still work. To switch to transparent
serial mode, define XBEE_TRANSPARENT_MODE in radio.h.

- Tethered operation (in the *old* radio mode only). Select your Arduino's
COM port from the test interface and bypass the radios altogether.

- Competition control (in transparent serial mode only).

- A two-byte hash field can be sent with the packet for a small measure of
security during competition. This is enabled by defining the constant
HASHCODE in radio.h. (Only works in transparent serial mode.)
