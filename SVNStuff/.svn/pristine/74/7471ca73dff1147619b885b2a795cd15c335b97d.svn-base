Firmware for the Motor Controller developed in-house
by Berkeley Pioneers in Engineering.

The following projects can be opened with the Arduino 
IDE available at www.arduino.cc

-- "/piemotorcontroller": Basic firmware for the 
   motor controller.

-- "/piemotorledblinker": Firmware which blinks the 
   status LEDs to confirm that the microcontroller is
   working.

-- "/i2ctester": Firmware running on another Arduino 
   which translates commands sent via the serial port
   to I2C messages for the purpose of sending test 
   commands to the motor controller.

-- "/spitester": Firmware to run on an Arduino which 
   translates commands sent via the serial port to 
   SPI data for the purpose of sending test commands.
   Not used for the motor controller, but may be 
   useful for testing some SPI sensors for PiE.
